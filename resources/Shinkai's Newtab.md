# Shinkai's Newtab
This extension changes your new tab page so that scenes from Makoto Shinkai's movies can play as seamless, looping cinemagraphs in the background.

The movies included are:
- Kimi no Na Wa (Your Name)
- Byousoku 5 Centimeter (5cm/s)
- Kotonoha no Niwa (Garden of Words)

The project is open sourced, you can check it out [here](https://github.com/suitangi/Minimal-Newtab). I don't collect any user data; this extension does need to be online to work though (to load the backgrounds, as it does not download them).
